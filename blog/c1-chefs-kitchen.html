        In a "Fireside Chat" video, Dev Bootcamp's Shereef uses a restaurant analogy to describe the proper attitude to take with you into the coding bootcamp. Instead of playing the role of a consumer sitting down at a table, he says, take on the mindset of a creator; that is, be the chef who takes responsibility for combining ingredients in a meaningful way, instead of the customer who picks things off the menu and complains to management when they don't come out perfectly.

        It's hard for me to say exactly how I will engage with this kind of culture. I've previously had an experience with a very intensive short-term language immersion program, and I learned that the bootcamp-like style of education can be a great fit for me. I expect DBC to be, in regards to fit, no different. I know it will push me very, very hard, and that it will vertainly bring about personal growth and development. Where exactly this development will take me, though, I don't yet know, and that's part of what makes it so exciting!

        My expectations for DBC have remained fairly constant since I got really into reading about it during the application process. I'm really, really excited to be a part of it, even if it does make me somewhat nervous: there are still a lot of unknowns for me as to how DBC culture will feel to me when I'm onsite, but I've already committed myself in advance to adjusting to it and letting it absorb me and push me past my limits. I love it!
