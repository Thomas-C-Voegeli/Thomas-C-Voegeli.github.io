  <h1>Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h1>

        So why is version control important, anyway? Let's take a look at a couple different scenarios to see what it's good for.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let's say you're making an oil painting of an alpine landscape, Bob Ross style (yes, that has nothing at all to do with programming, work with me here). You get halfway through and you're feeling good about things - the canvas in front of you is showing real potential. You have two ideas for how it could go forward; the friendly little pine tree could go on the right hand side, or on the left. You decide to go with the right hand side, and then you finish it and realize it's thrown the entire painting out of balance and made it all look irreparably terrible. It's at this point that you'd probably wish you could go back in time to the moment when you made the wrong decision and try something else instead. With version control, you can do exactly that. In fact, you can conjure up an infinite number of canvases from any point at all in the painting process, allowing you to experiment as you please without risking any of the work you know is good. Pretty cool, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
        For the second scenario, let's say you're doing the same painting, but halfway through, you decide that you and your friend should work on it together. He's going to paint the grass, and you're going to paint the trees - they occupy different parts of the painting so your work won't overlap each others'. So you could either fumble around and bump into each other all day trying to work in front of the same easel, or you could let him work on the painting first before he brings it back over to your place for you to paint the trees. But wouldn't it be better if you could each take a copy home, paint your separate parts, and then magically "merge" them both together, capturing all the best parts of each of your work? Yes, it would. This is precisely what version control, and specifically Git and GitHub, let you do.
    </p>
    <p>
        So Git is version control software that hangs out on your local machine. By letting you create multiple clones and "forks" of repositories (like magically making copies of the canvas in the above examples), you can make your changes to a non-critical copy of the work and evaluate the changes you made before you decide whether or not you want to merge them with the main project. Make sense? Whenever you want to, you can do a quick status check and have it show you all the files that have undergone changes during the history of the project, then you can decide what changes you want to commit to. So what about sharing with your friend, though?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where GitHub comes in. Storing your code online lets your friends/coworkers/neighborhood hobos/etc. all have access to your code, so that they too can make copies onto their local computers, make changes, and then send the changes back to you with the proposal that you include them in the main project. It lets everyone simultaneously work on their own part of the same project. So you post your canvas to GitHub, your friend copies it to his computer and paints the grass while you paint the trees on your own machine, and then you both merge them back to the online repository and GitHub combines them into one finished product.

        Cool stuff.
